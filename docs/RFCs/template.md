## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Explain the problem this proposal solves in detail, including necessary background. Provide specific use cases where this feature helps and how.

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it were already implemented and you were teaching it to another developer:

- Introduce new named concepts.
- Explain largely in terms of examples.
- Describe how developers should think about the feature and its impact.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages or migration guidance.
- Discuss how this impacts the ability to read, understand, and maintain code.

## Reference-level explanation

Technical details of the design:

- Interaction with other features.
- How the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases dissected by example.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. Does this feature exist in other compilers or languages and what experience have their communities had?

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through implementation?
- What related issues are out of scope for this RFC?

## Future possibilities

Think about the natural extension and evolution of this proposal and how it would affect the project as a whole.
