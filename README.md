# tuffy
An experimental optimizing compiler written by LLM

> **Note:** This project is currently in an experimental stage. External pull requests are not accepted at this time.

## Goals

Tuffy aims to be a production-grade, language-agnostic optimizing compiler backend.

- **Multi-language backend** — Serve as a codegen backend for multiple programming languages, not just Rust
- **Custom IR** — Design and implement a custom intermediate representation with optimization passes
- **Multi-platform** — Support multiple target architectures from the ground up
- **Balanced optimization** — Pursue both fast compilation and competitive runtime performance
- **Formal verification** — Provide formal correctness guarantees for optimization passes
